	Cricket is one of the most watched game in the world.  People are attracted to watch interesting events of the match but creating such sports highlights is a tedious job. We propose a model to automatically generate highlights of the cricket match. Key events of the  cricket match are fours, sixes, wickets. Here highlights of the cricket match is generated by recognizing excitation events and event driven features like replays, score board, scene identification. First, the replay and advertisements are removed. Then event for each live frames are detected. Shot boundary is formed based on the event tags. Scores for each shot is recognized and compared to identify highlights. Excitement of commentators and crowd cheering is analyzed for detecting highlights. Both the highlights are combined for final highlights. The system is tested with different kinds of input to demonstrate the effectiveness. User study is also done to evaluate the system in real life scenarios.
